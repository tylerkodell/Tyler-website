        <p class="lead mb-4">I attended the How’s your sleep workshop, presented by UC Riverside’s Counseling & Psychological Services on Thursday, May 13th. The main purpose of this workshop is self-explanatory, to teach about sleep and its importance to one’s mental and physical health. We also learned tips how to unwind and receive better quality sleep. One of the tips shared was to stay away from blue light before sleeping, because blue light suppresses the body’s production of melatonin- an important hormone produced by the body that controls sleep. In short terms, blue light from electronic devices keeps one awake. Some recommendations were to turn on blue light filters on our devices, or just stay away from electronics devices all together before bed. A second recommendation was to always strive to get eight hours of sleep a night, ideally every night. Lack of sleep is plain bad for the body. It can generate negative emotions, hurt academic performance, and damage physical and mental health. For emotions, sleep deprivation can cause depression, mood swings, and much more. Memory, concentration, and learning are hindered when sleep deprived, having the potential to damage academic performance significantly. Lastly, sleep deprivation can cause high blood pressure, weaken your immune system, increase risk of diabetes and heart disease, and cause weight gain. Finally, a major potential risk of lack of sleep are accidents, from things such as falling asleep at the steering wheel or not seeing a car when crossing the street. All these reasons stated really show why sleep is important for the body, mentally, and physically. I have always had the bad habit of staying up, but these reasoned stated at this workshop have made me rethink my decisions, and want to strive for a healthier sleep cycle.
